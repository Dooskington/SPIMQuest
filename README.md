# SPIMQuest (UB Hacking 2017)
Made this fun little spooky game for UB Hacking 2017. The goal is to collect MIPS instructions scattered around the maze, while also avoiding a secret and ancient threat. Use W,A,S,D to move/turn, and Q,E to strafe. Somehow it won third place, here's a video of me demoing it:

## Compiling and Running
Run with `cargo run --release`. Note that the SDL2, SDL2_image, and SDL2_gfx development libraries will be required to compile this.

Being a hackathon project, it's only tradition that the code quality is horrendous. Enjoy!
